# Executive Summary:
This project involves the development of a personal portfolio website aimed at showcasing my skills, projects, and professional background as a computer science student. The primary objective is to create a responsive, user-friendly site that serves as a digital resume for potential employers and peers. Target users include recruiters, fellow developers, and academic professionals. The website is built using core web technologies: HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript (ES6) for interactivity. Key features include sections for personal information, project showcases, and contact details, with a responsive design ensuring accessibility across devices. The site is deployed on GitHub Pages for free, reliable hosting.
